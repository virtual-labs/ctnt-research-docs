# Research Projects

## Generative AI
Virtual Labs is seeking to integrate Generative AI into various aspects of content generation, such as summarizing content for users and generating questions based on content. The following series of projects will address different stages of this initiative:

- Identify open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) suitable for fine-tuning for educational purposes.
- Identify LLMs pertinent to educational contexts through prompt engineering.
- Identify and collect data necessary for fine-tuning or prompt engineering.
- Conduct cost analysis of different types of LLM solutions, including the expenses associated with fine-tuning, deploying the fine-tuned model, and utilizing APIs in the case of closed-source solutions.

## Content Structure
- Build a knowledge dependency graph for all data structures elements of Virtual Labs. The project will entail defining a hierarchical knowledge graph and building an API to manipulate it.

## WebAssembly
- Port the Verilog compiler to WebAssembly
- Port the Spice Code compiler to WebAssembly
- Port a light-weight python interpreter to WebAssembly

## Analytics
- Define and implement an analytics system for e-learning content. This project will first define a model of the metrics relevant for e-learning content. Afterwards the model will be implemented as a framework, which can be integrated with any e-learning project.
