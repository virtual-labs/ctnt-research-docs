# Virtual Labs - Research Projects

## Generative AI
Virtual Labs is seeking to integrate Generative AI into various aspects of content generation, such as summarizing content for users and generating questions based on content. The following series of projects will address different stages of this initiative:

1. Build an agentic pipeline for creation of questions on a given topic and integrate it with the National Questions Repository of Virtual Labs
1. Identify open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) suitable for fine-tuning for educational purposes.
1. Identify LLMs pertinent to educational contexts through prompt engineering using zero-shot and few shot prompting.
1. Identify and collect data necessary for fine-tuning and prompt engineering.
1. Conduct cost and performance analysis of different types of LLM solutions, including the expenses associated with fine-tuning, deploying the fine-tuned model, and utilizing APIs in the case of closed-source API based solutions.
1. Build a GenAI powered search bot on top of the Virtual Labs document vector store
1. Build an automated agent to create social media posts, which can be triggered by various activities of content addition, modification and deployment
1. Build a prompt repository containing standardized set of prompts for different GenAI models to facilitate tasks and  activities like question generation, image generation, blog post generation, document formatting etc.

## Content Structure
1. Build a knowledge dependency graph for all data structures elements of Virtual Labs. The project will entail defining a hierarchical knowledge graph and building an API to manipulate it.
1. Build a metadata repository for all experiments and labs under Virtual Labs. The metadata can be used for search, filtering etc on different Virtual Labs platforms
1. Define and implement a Schema for e-learning content which can be contributed to Schema.org for standardization over the Web
1. Define a domain specific language for specifying a Virtual Labs simulation. Implement a framework to convert this specification into code
1. Build an open questions repository for Virtual Labs

## WebAssembly
1. Port the Verilog compiler to WebAssembly
1. Port the Spice Code compiler to WebAssembly
1. Port the SDCC Compiler Suite to WebAssembly
1. Port a light-weight python interpreter to WebAssembly

## Software Engineering
1. Build reusable components for all Virtual Labs data structure experiments
1. Upgrade the Virtual Labs cloud infrastructure

## Tools
1. Build a plagiarism validator tool for Virtual Labs
1. Integrate a programming interface to Virtual Labs. The interface should be able to validate the correctness of the code.
1. Build a progressive web app for Virtual Labs
1. Build a web based development environment for Virtual Labs

## Systems
1. Build a debug support agent with help from
  - Structured incident reports
  - Vector Document database
  - GenAI
1. Build an automated service deployment pipeline given a repository

## Analytics
1. Define and implement an analytics system for e-learning content. This project will first define a model of the metrics relevant for e-learning content. Afterwards the model will be implemented as a framework, which can be integrated with any e-learning project.
